A Simon Game project as part of the projects for freeCodeCamp. 
The play sequence is for twenty turns. 
If strict mode is on, the game resets once a mistaken button is pushed. 
The error face and happy face will likely appear out of place on various browser 
settings. The error handling code mostly works, but if you get click-happy, 
the timing will break.
